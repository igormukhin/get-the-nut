Get The Nut: The game simulator and solution finder
=============================

This is a Java implementation of the game [Get The Nut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pixibots.games.getthenut.com) and a class that is able to search for a solution with the least rolls.

#### Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with the authors of the game ([Pixibots](http://www.pixibots.com/)). 

#### Why

As I played the game I solved all the levels but couldn't find any solutions for Swamp/Level 36. So I decided to write this solver and practice some TDD.

#### How to use

If you want so find the shortest solution for a level, take a look at the `SolverTest` class.
